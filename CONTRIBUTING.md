## Contributions
> First of all, thank you for stopping by to check out FlutterMatic source code. We believe in open-source and would love to see you submit pull requests.

To get started, we allow people to create pull requests, or PRs. When creating a PR, make sure you include the following information:
  - What changes you made? (bug fixes, feature, etc)
  - Are there any breaking changes that we should know about?
  - Did you write tests for the changes you have made if applicable?
  
 We take the time to check out each PR and it will be merged if we think it's a great addition to the source code.
