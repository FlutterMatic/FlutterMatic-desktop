## Editors Documentation
- You can install up to two editors that work best with Flutter:
    - Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    - Android Studio (Studio)
These editors will be installed in the `fluttermatic` directory. We will make sure to set any necessary environment variables so that they can be interacted with in the CLI.

### Keeping the Editors Updated
Keeping editors updated is always a good idea. However, because of some limitations in the way that we can communicate with the editors, you will need to manually check for updates in your editors to keep your editors up-to-date always.

### Emulators
Emulators are used to run Flutter apps on your device. They are used to test your apps and make sure that they work as expected. If you need to install any emulator, we will help guide you through the process later after the editor installation is complete.

## Extensions
- You can install extensions for Flutter in your editors. These extensions are used to make your editors more user-friendly and compatible to open `dart` files which are used to write Flutter apps.
