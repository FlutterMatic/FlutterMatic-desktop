## Git Documentation
Git is a version control system that is used to track changes in your code. Git is installed automatically and required when installing Flutter. It is used with the pub service. This service is how you will be able to download packages from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). We will make sure to set the environment variables so that Git can be used in the future and interacted directly with the CLI.
 
### Keeping Git Updated
Keeping in mind that it is always a good idea to keep any tool up-to-date, with that in mind, we will keep checking to make sure you always have the latest version of Git installed on your device.
