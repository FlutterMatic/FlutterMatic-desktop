## Creating New Projects
FlutterMatic helps you easily create a new project without the need to use a command-line interface (CLI). This means that you can create new Flutter or Dart projects without having to learn any command-line tools. You can add dependencies or dev dependencies directly with our UI interface.

## Dart Templates
When creating a Dart project, you can choose a template on which your project will be based. You can choose from the following templates:
  - console-simple: A simple command-line application. (Default)
  - console-full: A command-line application sample.
  - package-simple: A starting point for Dart libraries or applications.
  - server-shelf: A server app using `package:shelf`
  - web-simple: A web app that uses only core Dart libraries.

## Adding Dependencies
FlutterMatic is a dependency manager for Flutter and Dart projects. It helps you manage your dependencies and dependencies of your dependencies. You can add dependencies and dev dependencies to your projects by searching and adding. We can also help notify you when a dependency is outdated so that you can always keep your dependencies up to date.

## Pre-Configs for Flutter Projects
