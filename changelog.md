### v0.0.1 - ALPHA

FlutterMatic has been under development for a while now. And some good news! FlutterMatic can now be used to install Flutter, however, keep in mind that this app is not stable and you may experience some errors or crashes in the worst cases, but worth a try!

If you want to install it on your device, make sure to download and extract the folder. Open the `.exe` file inside that extracted folder to open FlutterMatic. If you want to create a shortcut, reference the shortcut to that `.exe` file.
